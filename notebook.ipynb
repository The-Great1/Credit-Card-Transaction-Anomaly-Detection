Your company processes thousands of credit card transactions daily. The fraud team has complained that their current rule-based system is missing too many sophisticated fraud attempts (False Negatives) but also flagging too many legitimate transactions (False Positives), annoying customers.\n\n**Your Objective**: Build a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions with a focus on maximizing Recall (catching fraud) while maintaining acceptable Precision (minimizing false alarms).\n\n1. The Data Source\nYou will use the industry-standard Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset hosted on Kaggle. This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.\n\nDataset Link: Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud\n\nThe \"Real World\" Twist: The dataset features (V1, V2, ... V28) are the result of a PCA transformation (to protect user confidentiality). The only features which have not been transformed are Time and Amount.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9fa8049e-59df-400d-a5e5-9e1e9738d8ff"},{"source":"### Import
